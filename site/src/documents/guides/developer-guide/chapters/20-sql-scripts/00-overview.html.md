The following sections describe how we handle the development of SQL scripts and their adjustments, including patch level fixes.
After reading this guide, the developer will have some knowledge about what is required to write the different SQL scripts, where they are located and how they are tested.   

## General Rules

* Use standard SQL when writing the SQL whenever possible. Use of database specific functions can be necessary sometimes, but it is **NOT** recommended.
